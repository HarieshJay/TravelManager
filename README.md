# Travel Manager

An ongoing web application project that provides services such as suggesting routes, and keeping track of airline/hotel arrangements, points of interest, budget and schedule. This site is still under development, so functionality is limited.

### Prerequisites

Utilizing [AMMPS](https://www.ampps.com/) would make the installation much simpler. After installing AMMPS on your machine, [modify](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) the Apache web-server, so that it can run ReactJS production files.

### Installing

After installing all the prerequisite software, clone this repository into your apache web-server folder

```
cd /path/to/www
git clone https://github.com/HarieshJay/TravelManager.git
```

Start the web-server, and navigate to the index.php folder in your web browser, which is located in the Pages directory.
This should be accessed at http://localhost/TravelManager/Pages/index.php.

## Built With

- [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/) - JavaScript library for the Front-end
- [PHP](https://www.php.net/) - Back-end software
- [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/)- Database software used

## Contributing

Though this is a personal project, I do welcome people to open issues if any bugs are found. However, the website is still in its early stages, so please hold off until the main features are implemented.
